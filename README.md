# 🌳 PRODIGY_DS_03: Decision Tree Classifier

This repository contains my submission for **Task 03** of the Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship.

## 📄 Project Overview
**Objective:** Build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service.
**Dataset:** [Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) (UCI Machine Learning Repository).

I analyzed demographic and behavioral data to predict if a client will subscribe to a **Term Deposit**. As a blockchain enthusiast, I view this as an analogy for predicting **Staking Behavior**—identifying which users are most likely to lock up liquidity for a fixed yield.

## 📊 Key Insights
* **Duration Matters:** The duration of the last contact was the most critical feature. Longer conversations significantly increase the likelihood of subscription (staking).
* **Outcome of Previous Campaigns:** Users who successfully subscribed in the past were highly likely to do so again (Behavioral Consistency).
* **Model Accuracy:** The Decision Tree achieved an accuracy of **~90%** on the test set.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
* **Scikit-Learn** (DecisionTreeClassifier, train_test_split)
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (For visualizing the Tree and Confusion Matrix)
